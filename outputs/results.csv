There are missing divs, incorrect use of heading tags, and semantic errors. The overall structure is not well-organized and lacks proper class names for styling.
- Semantics: 0/3 - The student's code has major semantic issues. Heading tags are used incorrectly (e.g., `<h1>` inside a `<div>`), and important elements like `<pre>` and `<code>` are missing, leading to incorrect rendering of code snippets. The use of `<header>` within the main content is also inappropriate.
- Logical Properties: 1/3 - The student demonstrates some understanding of basic HTML elements but fails to implement the logical structure required by the expected output. There are missing links, and the form implementation is incomplete.
- Navbar: 0/3 - There is no correctly implemented navigation bar. The button styling and placement are incorrect.
- Main Content: 2/3 - The student includes some of the main content, but it's not structured or styled according to the expected output. Paragraphs and headings are not used effectively, and the CSS example is not rendered correctly.
- Footer: 1/2 - The footer content is present but lacks the correct structure and styling. The placement and formatting are inconsistent with the expected output.
- UI and Code Quality: 2/3 - The student's CSS is minimal and does not implement the required styling for the elements. There's a lack of proper class assignments in the HTML, preventing effective CSS styling. Code indentation and formatting are also lacking.

Recommendations:

- Code Formatting: Follow consistent code formatting and indentation practices to improve readability.
- Review Expected Output: Carefully review the expected output and compare it with your submission to identify and correct any discrepancies.", "Files found.", "No"
"student-submissions/HARSHITHA UNIT TEST","15","- Structure: 2/3 - The HTML structure is generally good but uses 'container' instead of 'main' as the primary class which deviates from the expected output. Also, 'mailform' should be 'contact' and the button with class 'btn' should not have an inline style attribute.
- Semantics: 3/3 - Semantic HTML is appropriately used with correct heading levels, paragraphs, and links.
- Logical Properties: 3/3 - The layout is logically structured, making it easy to follow the content flow.
- Navbar: 2/3 - The navigation element (button) is present, and styled. The HTML class name is 'button', while it should be 'btn'.
- Main Content: 2/3 - The main content, including sections, paragraphs, and code snippets, are implemented. The heading in the content section is slightly different, 'Lets look at a CSS code' instead of 'Lets look at CSS code'.
- Footer: 1/2 - The footer is present with the correct information.
- UI and Code Quality: 2/3 - Code quality is good with organized CSS. Some improvements could be made to class naming consistency and adherence to the specified HTML structure, particularly concerning the use of common classes and IDs from the expected output. The student has used most of the css properties as required. There are few deviations in font-size and paddings of the elements. Overall, the code is readable and reasonably well-organized.", "Files found.", "No"
"student-submissions/jaya-test","14","- Structure: 2/3 - The student has a decent structure but uses `container` and `connect` which are not as descriptive as `main` and `contact` in the expected output. The `section` class is used in a confusing way.
- Semantics: 2/3 - The student uses appropriate semantic elements like `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, etc. but could benefit from more specific elements where appropriate, like `<form>`. The student does not wrap the input elements and button in a form element in the connect section.
- Logical Properties: 2/3 - The layout is mostly correct, but there are some inconsistencies in spacing and alignment compared to the expected output. The student should pay closer attention to the intended visual design.
- Navbar: 1/3 - There's no distinct navbar section. The button and title are simply placed at the top.
- Main Content: 3/3 - The main content is well-structured and includes the key elements: CSS descriptions, code examples, and links.

- UI and Code Quality: 3/3 - The student's CSS is generally well-written and organized. The student effectively uses CSS selectors and properties to style the page elements. The student also uses pseudo-classes and elements correctly.", "Files found.", "No"
"student-submissions/Nanda kishore Unit Test-1","17","- Structure: 3/3 - The student's HTML structure is well-organized and follows the expected output closely. The use of semantic elements is appropriate, and the overall structure enhances readability.
- Semantics: 2/3 - The student uses appropriate semantic elements, but there's a minor issue. The main div class name is different. It should be 'main' instead of 'nandhu'.
- Logical Properties: 3/3 - The student has implemented the layout using logical properties effectively, ensuring proper spacing and alignment of elements. The use of margin and padding is consistent and contributes to a visually appealing design.
- Navbar: 3/3 - The student has styled the navigation bar with appropriate colors, fonts, and spacing. The hover effects and transitions enhance the user experience, making the navigation bar interactive and user-friendly.
- Main Content: 1/3 - The student has implemented the main content section, but the class name is wrong so the styling is not reflecting correctly.
- Footer: 2/2 - The student has created a visually appealing footer with a clear call to action. The use of color, typography, and layout enhances the overall design and user experience of the footer section.
- UI and Code Quality: 3/3 - The student's code is well-formatted and easy to read. The use of comments and consistent indentation improves code maintainability and readability. The overall code quality is commendable.", "Files found.", "No"
"student-submissions/Shirisha-test","6","- Structure: 1/3 - The HTML structure is severely lacking. There's a missing `head` closing tag, the link to the stylesheet is incorrect (it links to an HTML page instead of a CSS file), and the structure of nested divs and elements is illogical (e.g., heading inside a div with class Siri).
- Semantics: 1/3 - Semantic HTML is poorly implemented. There's inconsistent use of headings (h1, h2, h3) and the button is incorrectly used with type='text'. The structure lacks proper sections and article elements for content organization.
- Logical Properties: 0/3 - The document flow is broken due to structural issues. The absence of proper containers and semantic elements disrupts the intended layout and logical grouping of content.
- Navbar: 0/3 - There is no recognizable navbar implementation, its just a heading and a button without correct styling and placement.
- Main Content: 1/3 - Some content is present (text paragraphs, headings), but its disorganized and lacks proper formatting. The code block is partially there, but misses key elements.
- Footer: 1/2 - The 'Lets Connect' section could be considered a rudimentary footer, but it's incomplete (missing form input for name and email) and lacks styling. The final statement is present but not as per expected output.
- UI and Code Quality: 1/3 - The UI is very basic and unstyled. The CSS is minimal and only sets the font family. Code quality is low due to missing tags, incorrect link to stylesheet, lack of proper indentation and no CSS implementation as per the required design and functionality.", "Files found.", "No"
"student-submissions/shiva test","13","- Structure: 2/3 - The HTML structure is not well organized, missing some divs that are in the expected output, and incorrect use of the class attribute `class=''class`.
- Semantics: 2/3 -  The student is missing the correct use of the `<section>` tag, using `div` instead. The `<form>` tag is also missing, the `href` is missing from the second `<a>` element.
- Logical Properties: 2/3 - The student did not implement all the required properties.
- Navbar: 1/3 - The student implemented a button, but the styling is not the same as the expected output.
- Main Content: 3/3 - The main content is implemented correctly.
- Footer: 1/2 - The student didn't use the correct `h5` tag.
- UI and Code Quality: 2/3 - The code is properly formatted and indented, but some CSS properties are missing.", "Files found.", "No"
"student-submissions/veena-test","6","- Structure: 1/3 - The HTML structure is fundamentally flawed. The `<!DOCTYPE<html>` tag is incorrect; it should be `<!DOCTYPE html>`.  The `<meta>` tag's `content` attribute is malformed (`width='device-width intial-scale='1.0'` should be `width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0`). The closing tags and nesting of elements are incorrect, such as `<body>` being closed prematurely inside the `<code>` block, and there's no closing tag for the main `div`.
- Semantics: 1/3 - The use of semantic HTML is very limited.  There's a missing `<form>` tag in the contact section, no usage of `<label>` element, and improper nesting. The button inside `<h2>` is incorrect.
- Logical Properties: 1/3 -  The logical flow is broken due to structural errors.  Elements are closed prematurely, and nesting is incorrect. The CSS is completely empty, so there's no styling applied.
- Navbar: 0/3 - There is no proper navbar implementation. The 'Home' button attempt is syntactically incorrect (`<button>class='btn'>Home</button>` should be `<button class='btn'>Home</button>`).
- Main Content: 1/3 - The main content is present, but it lacks proper structure and styling, impacting readability and presentation. There are also some unclosed div tags. There is duplicate code inside of the example `<code>` tag.
- Footer: 0/2 - No footer is present.
- UI and Code Quality: 1/3 - The UI is practically non-existent due to the lack of CSS. The code quality is poor due to syntax errors, incorrect nesting, and missing closing tags.

Recommendations:

1.  **HTML Structure:** Correct the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration. Ensure proper nesting of HTML elements. Every opening tag must have a corresponding closing tag in the correct order. Use a code editor with HTML validation to catch these errors early.
2.  **Meta Tags:** Correct the viewport meta tag: `<meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0'>`.
3.  **Semantic HTML:** Utilize semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, etc., to structure your content. This improves accessibility and SEO.
4.  **CSS Styling:** Start writing CSS to style the HTML elements. Link the CSS file correctly in the HTML: `<link rel='stylesheet' href='style.css'>`.
5.  **Button Syntax:** The button syntax is incorrect. It should be `<button class='btn'>Home</button>`.
6.  **Form Implementation:** Wrap the input fields in a `<form>` element with appropriate attributes like `action` and `method`.  Use `<label>` elements for accessibility.
7.  **Code Indentation:** Maintain consistent code indentation to improve readability.
8.  **CSS Properties:** Familiarize yourself with basic CSS properties like `color`, `font-family`, `margin`, `padding`, `border`, etc.
9.  **Review Expected Output:** Carefully compare your output with the expected output and identify the differences. Focus on replicating the structure and styling.
10. **Start Small:** Begin with small, manageable sections and gradually build up the complete webpage. Validate your HTML and CSS frequently.", "CSS file is Missing", "Yes"
